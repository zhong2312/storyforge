# Phase 0 Status Log

> Purpose: record Phase 0 execution progress after each completed step so the project author can review partial state at any time.

Execution note: because the reviewer is temporarily unavailable, Phase 0 tasks after 0.1 are being implemented as stacked task branches and commits. They still require later independent review before main merge.

## Phase 0.1 - deleteGroup Transaction Scope

### 2026-06-08 17:02:38 CST

- Status: started.
- Branch: `refactor/phase-0-task-0.1`.
- Scope: only `MASTER-BLUEPRINT.md` Phase 0.1, `deleteGroup` transaction declaration and corresponding `R-01` regression verification.
- Existing dirty files before Phase 0.1 work:
  - `docs/MASTER-BLUEPRINT.md` existed dirty before this task.
  - `docs/refactor/HANDOFF.md` existed dirty before this task.
  - `docs/refactor/PROJECT_TABLES_ALL.md` was updated immediately before this task per project-author request.
- Rule: unrelated dirty files will not be reverted or included in the Phase 0.1 commit.

### 2026-06-08 17:02:57 CST

- Status: baseline infrastructure verified.
- Command: `npm install && npm test`.
- Result: install succeeded; Vitest passed existing suite.
- Baseline test state: `tests/regression/R-01-delete-group.test.ts` passed only the infrastructure case; the core deleteGroup regression case was still skipped before Phase 0.1 implementation.
- Note: `npm install` reported existing audit findings: 8 moderate, 5 high, 2 critical. This is outside Phase 0.1 scope and was not changed.

### 2026-06-08 17:04:56 CST

- Status: Phase 0.1 code path implemented and regression enabled.
- Changed `src/stores/world-group.ts`: added temporary Phase 0 `PROJECT_TABLES_ALL` with all 45 DB v26 Dexie tables and changed `deleteGroup` to use it for the transaction scope.
- Changed `tests/regression/R-01-delete-group.test.ts`: enabled the core deleteGroup regression case, loaded the store before deletion, and asserted no residual `worldGroupId`/`homeWorldGroupId` references across world-scoped data.
- Command: `npm test -- R-01`.
- Result: passed, 1 file / 2 tests.

### 2026-06-08 17:05:42 CST

- Status: Phase 0.1 verification passed.
- Command: `npx tsc --noEmit`.
- Result: passed with zero errors.
- Command: `npm run build`.
- Result: passed. Vite emitted existing bundle-size/dynamic-import warnings; no build failure.
- Command: `npm test`.
- Result: passed, 2 files / 6 tests.

## Phase 0.2 - migrateToMultiWorld Transaction Scope

### 2026-06-08 17:09:00 CST

- Status: started.
- Branch: `refactor/phase-0-task-0.2`.
- Branch base: stacked on top of `refactor/phase-0-task-0.1` because the project author explicitly requested continuing before Phase 0.1 review/merge.
- Scope: only `MASTER-BLUEPRINT.md` Phase 0.2, `migrateToMultiWorld` transaction declaration and corresponding `R-02` regression verification.
- Existing dirty files before Phase 0.2 work:
  - `docs/MASTER-BLUEPRINT.md` existed dirty before Phase 0.1.
  - `docs/refactor/HANDOFF.md` existed dirty before Phase 0.1.
  - `docs/refactor/PROJECT_TABLES_ALL.md` was updated before Phase 0.1 per project-author request.
- Rule: unrelated dirty files will not be reverted or included in the Phase 0.2 commit.

### 2026-06-08 17:09:48 CST

- Status: Phase 0.2 code path implemented and regression added.
- Changed `src/stores/world-group.ts`: added `db.codexEntries` to the `migrateToMultiWorld` transaction scope.
- Added `tests/regression/R-02-migrate-multiworld.test.ts`: verifies that existing codex entries are stamped to the primary world and migration does not throw.
- Command: `npm test -- R-02`.
- Result: passed, 1 file / 1 test.

### 2026-06-08 17:10:08 CST

- Status: Phase 0.2 verification passed.
- Command: `npm test -- R-01 R-02`.
- Result: passed, 2 files / 3 tests.
- Command: `npm test`.
- Result: passed, 3 files / 7 tests.
- Command: `npx tsc --noEmit`.
- Result: passed with zero errors.
- Command: `npm run build`.
- Result: passed. Vite emitted existing bundle-size/dynamic-import warnings; no build failure.

## Phase 0.3 - ensureSchema Delete-DB Risk

### 2026-06-08 17:14:00 CST

- Status: started.
- Branch: `refactor/phase-0-task-0.3`.
- Branch base: stacked on top of `refactor/phase-0-task-0.2` because the reviewer is temporarily unavailable and the project author requested continuing.
- Scope: `MASTER-BLUEPRINT.md` Phase 0.3, production schema self-check must not delete IndexedDB.
- Added project-level progress board: `docs/refactor/REFACTOR-PROGRESS.md`, including the Phase 1 three-registry foundation work so Phase 0 is not confused with the whole refactor.

### 2026-06-08 17:21:26 CST

- Status: Phase 0.3 code path implemented and regression added.
- Changed `src/lib/db/ensure-schema.ts`: added `REQUIRED_TABLES_V26` with all 45 DB v26 tables; added safe production behavior that blocks reset instead of calling `Dexie.delete()`.
- Changed `src/main.tsx`: passes `allowReset: import.meta.env.DEV`, so production builds do not auto-reset IndexedDB.
- Added `tests/regression/R-17-ensure-schema.test.ts`: checks table-list/schema consistency and verifies production missing-table path does not call `Dexie.delete()`.
- Command: `npm test -- R-17`.
- Result: passed, 1 file / 2 tests.

### 2026-06-08 17:22:56 CST

- Status: Phase 0.3 verification passed.
- Added `scripts/check-required-tables.mjs` and `npm run check:required-tables` so table-list drift fails locally/CI.
- Command: `npm test -- R-01 R-02 R-17`.
- Result: passed, 3 files / 5 tests.
- Command: `npm test`.
- Result: passed, 4 files / 9 tests.
- Command: `npx tsc --noEmit`.
- Result: passed with zero errors.
- Command: `npm run build`.
- Result: passed. Vite emitted existing bundle-size/dynamic-import warnings; no build failure.
- Command: `npm run check:required-tables`.
- Result: passed, 45 tables match `schema.ts`.

## Phase 0.4 - BUG-EXPORT-WG worldGroupId Remap

### 2026-06-08 17:29:30 CST

- Status: Phase 0.4 code path implemented and regression added.
- Branch: `refactor/phase-0-task-0.4`.
- Branch base: stacked on top of `refactor/phase-0-task-0.3`.
- Changed `src/lib/export/json-export.ts`: new exports convert `worldGroupId`/`homeWorldGroupId` into `_worldGroupExportId`/`_homeWorldGroupExportId`; imports create world groups first, then write remapped world ids directly into world-scoped rows.
- Added `tests/regression/R-03-export-world-group-remap.test.ts`: verifies export JSON no longer contains raw world ids and imported records point to the imported side world.
- Command: `npm test -- R-03`.
- Result: passed, 1 file / 1 test.

### 2026-06-08 17:31:52 CST

- Status: Phase 0.4 verification passed.
- Command: `npm test -- R-01 R-02 R-03 R-17`.
- Result: passed, 4 files / 6 tests.
- Command: `npm test`.
- Result: passed, 5 files / 10 tests.
- Command: `npm run check:required-tables`.
- Result: passed, 45 tables match `schema.ts`.
- Command: `npx tsc --noEmit`.
- Result: passed with zero errors.
- Command: `npm run build`.
- Result: passed. Vite emitted existing bundle-size/dynamic-import warnings; no build failure.
